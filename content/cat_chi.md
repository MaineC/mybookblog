This book is a book where you get to know a boy and a girl, both about the age of thirteen, the girl is a  warrior, and the boy is a wizard. 

It begins, I suppose, with the wizard boy. He is called Xar (pronouneced Zar, don't ask me why, spelling is WEIRD), and he is the most disobedient boy of all wizards. 
The girl is called Wish, and has a very frantic bodyguard. This girl (despite the fact that she is a warrrior PRINCESS) loves adventures. And she will get one very soon... 

But it's up to you, dear reader, if you will or won't know what soon in this story will happen to those three children!
