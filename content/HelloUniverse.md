# Buch: Hello Universe

In the book 'Hello, Universe', there are four persons with four perspectives. Kaori Tanaka, a would-be fortune teller, helps Virgil in some bad situations. Virgilio Salinas, also named Virgil, is a shy boy, hoping that someday Valencia will speak to him. Valencia Somerset, a girl with courage and assertiveness, is a person who is very intrested in nature. She studies squirrels, has a stray dog and knows the forest like her handback. Chet Bullens is a big, fat boy, and is also named 'The Bull'. Virgil doesn't only call him that because 'Bullens' is Chet's last name. He also is a big bully. All four were brought together, by some miracles and coincidences. Chet pushed Virgils backpack into a well and Virgil climbed after it. This is how he met Ruby Salavador and Pah, both figures from stories. The book shows how crazy miracles can be, as Valencia pushed the wooden lid over the well, and Virgil was trapped inside. But some time later, Valencia has a new friend.
