# How to train your dragon

Hiccup is the hero of the story "How to train your dragon". That is rather unbelievebale, because he is a very the normal Viking boy,
with red hair and a dragon called *Toothless*, which, as the name says it, has no teeth.

His enemies at home are Snotface Snotlaut and Dogsbreath the Duhbrain. They are better than Hiccup in practically everything, exept maybe swordfighting.
His enemies away are Alvin the Treacherous, a one-legged, one-armed, hair-challenged villain and Norbert the Nutjob, the chief of the Hysterics. There are many tribes but that is too complicated to
explain now. You need to read it yourself!

I recommend this book because it's a mixture of fun and thrill, and sometimes Hicccup is about to die.

Then I read really fast, trust me!
