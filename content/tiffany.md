# Book: The wee free men

[The Wee Free Men](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wee_Free_Men) are very little men who like "to fight, to drink and to drink and fight" (well, so they say...!). Well, but the main character is *Tiffany*, at the beginning of the book she slais *Jenny green-teeth* with a friyng pan (for Jenny and all other fairies  iron is very painful because iron is made by humans, not by nature - well, thats the short explanation), which seems to be very impressive to other witches. in the book Tiffany is a witch, - at the beginning of the story she doesn't know that - and she even gets a um.. real? Witch hat. Little hint: there are four books, so nothing bad should happen there... 

I like the book because it's sometimes really, really exciting, but also REALLY funny ;)
