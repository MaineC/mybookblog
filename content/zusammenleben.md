# Book: Zusammenleben, was ist das?

This is a book to read with children who have many curiosities. There are questions, answers and answers on the answers (yes, but...).

This is a example; 

Question: Must you respect the others all the time?

Answer: 
* No, because i can't like all the people.
* Yes, but...: Should you only respect the people who you like?
* Yes, but...: Can you respect someone without liking him?
* Yes, but...: Can you be the ones, the you like, not so respectful?

So, it's actually German, but it's a wonderful book!
