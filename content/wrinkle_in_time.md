# A Wrinkle in Time

[A Wrinkle in time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Wrinkle_in_Time) is a book that is very  thrilling, especially for children. In the book there are three children and three *witches*, 
if you want to name women that can travel through time and space name witches...

They travel to a planet that a big "IT" controls. They need to rescue the father from Meg, the main character in the book, the only problem is that this is anything but easy. 

I recommend this book because it has such a wonderful sweeet end. And because the three *witches* have a really cool  secret.
