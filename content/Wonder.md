# Book: Wonder

The Book 'Wonder' is a book which is quite realistic. August 'Auggie' Pullman, a ten-year-old kid, was born with a gene defect, which makes his face look 'deformed', as Julian describes it.
Auggie was homeschooled until he was in 5th grade, and finally got to a real school.

Wonder is told from different perspectives, as for Summer's (Auggies friend (NOT girlfriend)), Jack's (Auggies friend) and Via's (Auggies sister) perspective.
Via describes the family like this: "Auggie is the sun. Me, mom and dad are the big planets orbiting the sun. And our relatives and friends are the little aesteroids and moons orbiting the
Planets." Like this she describes it, and it's true. Other friends or Via are often closed out, as I may say, by Auggies and Vias parents. If Auggie had another operation, Via may sometimes 
become a little moon orbiting her mum and dad.

Juian is also a kid that's in Augusts new school. In the first book, 'Wonder', he is pictured as a mobber. 
But in the second book, 'Auggie and me', it's shown that even the worst mobbers have a backround. As for Julian, he got nightmares from Auggies face.
Julian already got this 'Nightmare problem' in 1rst grade, at a playdate. He and the other kid watched the movie: Harry Potter, and as Julian first saw Voldemort's face, 'I got a panic attack and my mom had to
get me home. Since then I never was on a playdate again.' Also, speaking of Julian's mom, she erased August from the class picture. Then she mailed it other moms, with the sentence:'We want no bad memories. Only good memories, right, Julian?'
