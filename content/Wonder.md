# Book: Wonder

The Book 'Wonder' is a book which is quite realistic. August 'Auggie' Pullman, a ten-year-old kid, was born with a gene defect, which makes his face look 'deformed', as Julian describes it.
Auggie was homeschooled until he was in 5th grade, and finally got to a real school.

Wonder is told from different perspectives, as for Summers (Auggies friend (NOT girlfriend)), Jacks (Auggies friend) and Vias (Auggies sister) perspective.
Via describes the family like this: "Auggie is the sun. Me, mom and dad are the big planets orbiting the sun. And our relatives and friends are the little aesteroids and moons orbiting the
Planets." Like this she describes it, and it's true. Other friends or Via are often closed out, as I may say, by Auggies and Vias parents. If Auggie had another operation, Via may sometimes 
become a little moon orbiting her mum and dad.
