# Book: Meine Freundin Roxy

[Meine Freundin Roxy](https://tulipan-verlag.de/meine-freundin-roxy-roboter-zaehmen-leicht-gemacht/) is a book for in tech interested children like me. Kenza Ait Si Abbou has written this cool book and Meike Topperwien has illustrated it. The book describes a little girl who finds a robot in a bush, takes it home. There together with her granny she repairs the robot and starts teaching it: She starts with simple language.

Girl: "This is a banana. Ba-na-na"

Roxy: "Banana"

Girl: "The banana is tasty. Ba-na-na - tas-ty"

Roxy: "Banana - tasty"

Girl: "This is a sock. Sock"

Roxy: "Sock. Tasty"

After a long while, she and the robot, which is named Roxy, are performing a play on stage. But, after they have performed the play, Roxy's owner wants to take Roxy with him. The girl explains him how much fun she had with Roxy, and then she keep her.

i like it because of the happy end, and because a GIRL has a realle cool robot named Roxy ;)
