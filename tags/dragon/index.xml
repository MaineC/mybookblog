That is rather unbelievebale, because he is a very the normal Viking boy, with red hair and a dragon called Toothless, which, as the name says it, has no teeth.
His enemies at home are Snotface Snotlaut and Dogsbreath the Duhbrain. They are better than Hiccup in practically everything, exept maybe swordfighting.</description></item></channel></rss>
