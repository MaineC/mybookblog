Well, but the main character is Tiffany, at the beginning of the book she slais Jenny green-teeth with a friyng pan (for Jenny and all other fairies iron is very painful because iron is made by humans, not by nature - well, thats the short explanation), which seems to be very impressive to other witches.</description></item></channel></rss>
