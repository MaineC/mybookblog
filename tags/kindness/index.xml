August &amp;lsquo;Auggie&amp;rsquo; Pullman, a ten-year-old kid, was born with a gene defect, which makes his face look &amp;lsquo;deformed&amp;rsquo;, as Julian describes it. Auggie was homeschooled until he was in 5th grade, and finally got to a real school.
Wonder is told from different perspectives, as for Summer&amp;rsquo;s (Auggies friend (NOT girlfriend)), Jack&amp;rsquo;s (Auggies friend) and Via&amp;rsquo;s (Auggies sister) perspective.</description></item></channel></rss>
